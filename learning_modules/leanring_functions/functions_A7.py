# Write a program that allows the user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the
# computer.
# When the program begins, you randomly choose a number from 0 to 2, which will
# represent the computerâ€™s choice with 0 for rock, 1 for paper, or 2 for scissors.
# The user then enters his/her choice of 0 for rock, 1 for paper, or 2 for scissors.
